Example Usage local world = AOP:World() world:Create() This function creates the world instance in the simulation using the current settings. Update Updates the world simulation by a specified number of steps and time delta. Parameters steps ( number ): The number of simulation steps to advance. deltaTime ( number ): The time increment for each simulation step. Example Usage world:Update(1, 0.016) This function advances the simulation by the given number of steps and time increment, updating the world state accordingly. GetState Retrieves the current state of the world. Returns state ( table ): The current state of the world. Example Usage local state = world:GetState() print(state) This function returns the current state of the world and logs it for analysis or debugging. GetStates Retrieves the history of world states since the last call. Returns stateHistory ( string ): A JSON string representing the history of world states. Example Usage local stateHistory = world:GetStates() print(stateHistory) This function returns a JSON string containing all the world states recorded since the last call to GetStates , and clears the history. Destroy Destroys the world, cleaning up resources and ending the simulation. Example Usage world:Destroy() This function destroys the world instance, releasing all associated resources and stopping the simulation. Example This example demonstrates how to create a world, configure its properties, and update its simulation. Code local world = AOP:World() -- Create a new world instance. world.gravity = {0.0, -9.81, 0.0} -- Set gravity to Earth's gravity. world.timeBeforeSleep = 1.0 -- Set time before bodies go to sleep to 1 second. world.maxBodies = 2048 -- Set maximum number of bodies to 2048. world:Create() -- Initialize the world with these settings. world:Update(1, 0.016) -- Advance the simulation by one step (0.016 seconds). local currentState = world:GetState() -- Retrieve the current state of the world. print(\"Current State:\", currentState) local stateHistory = world:GetStates() -- Retrieve and clear the history of world states. print(\"State History:\", stateHistory) world:Destroy() -- Destroy the world and clean up resources.
