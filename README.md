# AO Physics

${\color{white}\Huge{\textsf{Version: }} \color{orange}\Huge{\textsf{0.0.5}}}$

AO Physics is a powerful and flexible physics simulation system designed for creating realistic physical interactions within a virtual environment. It provides components for defining worlds, bodies, and constraints, allowing for detailed and accurate simulations.

## Features

- **World Management**: Configure and manage the overall simulation environment, including gravity, time settings, and more.
- **Body Dynamics**: Define physical objects with attributes like position, velocity, and mass, and manage their interactions.
- **Constraints**: Implement various constraints to simulate joints, connections, and interactions between bodies.
- **Character Interaction**: Define and manage characters within the simulation, including their attributes, behaviors, and interactions with the environment and other characters.
