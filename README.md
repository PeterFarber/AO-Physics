# AO Physics

AO Physics is a powerful and flexible physics simulation system designed for creating realistic physical interactions within a virtual environment. It provides components for defining worlds, bodies, and constraints, allowing for detailed and accurate simulations.

## Features

- **World Management**: Configure and manage the overall simulation environment, including gravity, time settings, and more.
- **Body Dynamics**: Define physical objects with attributes like position, velocity, and mass, and manage their interactions.
- **Constraints**: Implement various constraints to simulate joints, connections, and interactions between bodies.

## Documentation

For detailed documentation on how to use AO Physics, including configuration, methods, and examples, please visit the [AO Physics Documentation](https://peterfarber.github.io/AO-Physics/).

The documentation covers:

- **[World](https://peterfarber.github.io/AO-Physics/world)**: Overview and configuration of the simulation environment.
- **[Body](https://peterfarber.github.io/AO-Physics/body)**: Properties and methods for defining and managing physical bodies.
