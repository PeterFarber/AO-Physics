- **Set Position:** The `position` property sets the sphere's location in 3D space.
- **Set Layer:** The `layer` property is set to `"MOVING"`, indicating the body is part of the moving layer.
- **Activate the Body:** The `activate` property is set to `true` to enable the body in the simulation.
- **Add to Simulation:** The `Add` method is called to add the body to the physics simulation.
- **Set Linear Velocity:** The `SetLinearVelocity` method is used to set the body's linear velocity to `(0.0, 0.0, 5.0)`, influencing its movement in the simulation.
